# UART-Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
Implementation of Uart protocol using *`Verilog`*
</br>
</br>
</br>
The project involves designing and simulating a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system in Verilog, including both transmitter and receiver modules, to enable serial communication by converting parallel data into serial form for transmission and vice versa for reception. The design is verified through a comprehensive test bench in a simulation environment like Vivado.

## INTRODUCTION
A basic UART system provides robust, moderate-speed, full-duplex communication with only three signals: Tx (transmitted serial data), Rx (received serial data), and ground. In contrast to other protocols such as SPI and I2C, no clock signal is required because the user gives the UART hardware the necessary timing information.Actually, there is a clock signal, but it is not transmitted from one communicating device to the other; rather, both receiver and transmitter have internal clock signals that govern how the changing logic levels are generated (on the Tx side) and interpreted (on the Rx side). Unsurprisingly, UART communication doesnâ€™t work if the transmitter and receiver have been configured for different data-transmission frequencies. Also, the internal clock signals must be 1) sufficiently accurate relative to the expected frequency and 2) sufficiently stable over time and temperature.
