# UART-Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter
Implementation of Uart protocol using *`Verilog`*
</br>
</br>
</br>
The project involves designing and simulating a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) system in Verilog, including both transmitter and receiver modules, to enable serial communication by converting parallel data into serial form for transmission and vice versa for reception. The design is verified through a comprehensive test bench in a simulation environment like Vivado.
